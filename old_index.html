<h1>Welcome to Shashwat's homepage</h1>
<i>I know this page isn't really as good, visually, as is expected of a computer science student in 2014, but I really am not the kind of person you'd want designing, well, anything. Also, I prefer a simple layout like this. If you have a good CSS file, I may consider putting it here (But I probably won't).</i>
